            <h1>EDUCATION FOR ALL</h1>
            <p>Education is a gift for life. We help children reach school and stay there.

                We help children unlock their potential and realise their dreams. We believe that every child is extraordinary and can scale great heights if provided with the right learning opportunities. With regular and generous contributions from our supporters, we are able to march steadily towards achieving these goals.
                
                We are committed to ensure that all children, irrespective of their origin, are able to go to school, play, interact and learn with other children of their age. We help children with limited means hone their creativity and skills under the guidance of trained teachers and make persistent efforts to enable them to secure a life of dignity for themselves, their families and the community at large.
                
                In nine states of India, Save the Children runs programmes to support the education of the most disadvantaged children of India in different ways.  </p>
          <h1>CORONA THE BIG CRISES</h1>
          <P>Save the Children India has had a history of being the first responder to any crisis that affect children or their community adversely. The same applies to the current health emergency that has impacted all but some more than the others. All our resources, support staff, partner NGOs, and health experts have joined forces to stand up firmly in solidarity and support of the most affected and children living on the fringes struggling to make their way out of this emergency unscathed.
            While we do not know as of now, how long this is going to last, but what we do know is that we will be the last one to leave.
             
            According to the WHO Global Dashboard, as of 30 March, 638,146 cases of Coronavirus have been confirmed, and 30,039 deaths have been reported across 203 countries. As the virus moves to low-income countries, most worrying is the impact, it could have among vulnerable and at-risk children and communities living on the fringes of society.</P>
